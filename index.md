## Web Designer & Front-end Developer

Hi, my name's Dave. I'm a Web Designer and Front-end Developer based in Bristol, currently working for [Simpleweb](https://simpleweb.co.uk) as a Front-end Developer.

With over 8 years professional experience, I've been building up my skills in design, UI development, and front-end development, working with some really exciting people like [BaseKit](https://basekit.com) and [Envato Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/).

In my spare time, I also write [articles](https://david.darn.es) and work on [open-source projects](https://daviddarnes.github.io), such as [Anchor CMS](https://github.com/anchorcms/anchor-cms) and [Alembic theme](https://alembic.darn.es).

If you'd like chat, [get in touch](http://enable-javascript.com/ "my email").
