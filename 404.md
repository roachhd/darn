## Page Not Found

I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, [that'll be the end of it][1]{: style="color: #347794; animation: none"}. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. [But if you don't][2]{: style="color: #C80200; animation: none"}, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.
